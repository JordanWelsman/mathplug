# Overview

 `mathplug` is a lightweight Python package which supplies simple math functions. It was primarily designed as an excuse to learn how to publish a Python package. Secondarily, this will give me an opportunity to learn some of the more complicated mathematical equations since I somehow skipped that part. In the future, you'll be able to `install` and `import` this software into your notebook or Python file and use it to add some numbers together. _How exciting!_

## Install & use

1. From terminal:
`shell pip install mathplug`
2. From python environment:
`import mathplug`

## Test

1. Clone repository:
`git clone https://github.com/JordanWelsman/mathplug.git`
2. Build module:
`<python | python3> setup.py bdist_wheel`
3. Install module locally:
`pip install -e . dev`
4. cd to source directory:
`cd mathplug/mathplug`
5. Run tests with `PyTest`:
`pytest`
