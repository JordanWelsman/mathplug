## Overview

 `mathplug` is a lightweight Python package which supplies simple math functions. It was primarily designed as an excuse to learn how to publish a Python package. Secondarily, this will give me an opportunity to 'learn how to learn some of the more complicated mathematical equations since I somehow skipped that part. In the future, you'll be able to `install` and `import` this software into your notebook or Python file and use it to add some numbers tohether. _How exciting!_
