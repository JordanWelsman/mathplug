## Overview

 `mathplug` is a lightweight Python package which supplies simple math functions. It was primarily designed as an excuse to learn how to publish a Python package. Secondarily, this will give me an opportunity to learn some of the more complicated mathematical equations since I somehow skipped that part. In the future, you'll be able to `install` and `import` this software into your notebook or Python file and use it to add some numbers together. _How exciting!_

### Install & use

1. From terminal:
`shell pip install mathplug`
2. From python environment:
`import mathplug`
